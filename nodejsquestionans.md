**Buffers**
A Buffer in Node.js is a temporary storage area for binary data. It is used to handle raw memory allocations outside the V8 engine, making it efficient for working with files, streams, and network data. Unlike JavaScript strings, Buffers allow direct manipulation of binary data.

Buffers are especially useful when working with binary data, such as reading files or handling network streams. They allow efficient manipulation of raw memory without converting data into strings.

```js
const buf = Buffer.from('Node.js');
console.log(buf); // <Buffer 4e 6f 64 65 2e 6a 73>
console.log(buf.toString()); // 'Node.js'
console.log(buf.length); // 7 (Bytes)
```

Streams in Node.js are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous, efficient manner. Instead of loading the entire data into memory (like files or large responses), streams process data in chunks, making them ideal for handling large amounts of data (e.g., files, network requests).
