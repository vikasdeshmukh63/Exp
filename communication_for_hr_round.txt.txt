B. MANAGERS ROUND (BEHAVIOUR ROUND):-

    1. Tell me about yourself ? (ans should be brief)
            "Hi, I’m Vikas Deshmukh, and I’m a full-stack developer with 1.5 years of experience specializing in the MERN stack. 
            I graduated with [Your Degree] from [University Name]. I currently work at [Current Company Name], where I develop scalable,
            responsive web applications using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js.In my current role, I handle both front-end and 
            back-end development, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions. I have a strong problem-solving 
            mindset and focus on writing clean, efficient code. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I believe 
            my background in full-stack development and passion for building robust applications would allow me to contribute effectively to your team."

    2. Explain your project ? (explain the workflow of project)

    3. Roles and responsibilities ?

    4. Day to day work ?

    5. Tell me somethign about your current company ?

    6. Why are u looking for change ? (give a sensible reason)
            "I am looking for a change because I believe it’s time for me to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. While I have gained valuable
            experience in my current role, particularly in full-stack development with technologies like React, Next.js, and Node.js, I am eager to work 
            in a dynamic environment where I can contribute to more complex projects and collaborate with a diverse team. I’m excited about the opportunity 
            to bring my skills to [Company Name], and I believe the growth potential and innovative work at your company align well with my career aspirations."

    7. What challanges are u faced while doing this project  and how u fixed it ?
            "One challenge I faced in this project was optimizing the performance of the application when dealing with large datasets. The front-end had to render
            real-time data efficiently without affecting user experience. I implemented lazy loading and pagination on the front-end with React, while optimizing 
            API calls on the back-end using Node.js to ensure faster data retrieval. This helped maintain a smooth, responsive UI even with large volumes of data, 
            and I learned the importance of performance tuning at both ends."

    8. Describe a challanging technical problem u have faced recently ?
            "Recently, I faced a challenging technical problem when integrating third-party APIs into a project. The APIs had inconsistent data formats and occasional
            latency issues, which impacted the user experience. To address this, I implemented a robust error-handling system and introduced data normalization processes
            on the back-end using Node.js. Additionally, I added caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve response times. This solution improved both the reliability
            and performance of the application."

    9. is there any client interaction ?
            only when there are any blockers or after completing a sprint while demo

    10. Explain latest issue that you discussed with client ?
            "Recently, I worked with the client to address integration challenges between the three portals in our application. The issue was ensuring smooth data 
            synchronization between the AI interview portal, recruiter portal, and candidate portal, especially when candidates’ data like resumes and video verifications 
            had to reflect accurately during interviews. I optimized the backend API for efficient data handling and improved the front-end interface for better user experience. 
            The client was satisfied with the solution, and we’re now in the final stages of testing."

Steps in the Flow:
(A): The client sends the user to the authorization server to request access.
(B): The authorization server sends an authorization code back to the client.
(C): The client sends the authorization code to the token endpoint.
(D): The token endpoint responds with an access token.
(E): The client uses the access token to request resources from the resource server.
(F): The resource server responds with the requested resources.
