Definition of MVC Architecture:
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software design pattern used to separate an application's logic into three interconnected components:

Model: Manages the data, business logic, and rules of the application.
View: Handles the user interface (UI) and displays data to the user.
Controller: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, handling user input and updating the Model or View accordingly.
This separation of concerns improves code organization, scalability, and maintainability, making it easier to develop and modify applications.

Key Differences between singletone and mvc design

Scope:
MVC is a complete architectural pattern for organizing the structure of an application.
Singleton is a design pattern focused on ensuring a class has a single instance throughout the application.

Purpose:
MVC focuses on organizing the components of an application into clear roles (data, UI, and logic).
Singleton focuses on ensuring a class is instantiated only once and managing access to that instance.

In short, they are separate design patterns used for different purposes. MVC helps structure an app, while Singleton ensures only one instance of a specific class exists.
